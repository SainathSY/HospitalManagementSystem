<h3>Hospitals interact with a lot of people in a day and there are various activities involved in day to day operations of hospitals, for example booking of appointments, managing doctor schedules, managing patient diagnoses, managing medical histories of patients, etc. The aim of this project is to show how data related to these tasks can be made easier to manage using databases. In the Existing system Doctor don’t have access to patients medical history. Appointment is done via phone calls, involving extra manpower. Physical prescription are given to patients, that might be lost. Appointment slots might crash due to manual booking. Patients cannot rate the consultation experience.</h3>
<h3>Overcoming existing system’s drawbacks, our HMS allows patients to book an appointment online at his/her desired time slot thereby reducing the extra manpower required at hospitals. Prescription details of each patient is stored electronically in database which reduce the risk of losing them and also allow doctors to track patients history of treatment.Billing and payment details are stored electronically in database allowing both the concerned staff and patient to keep track of payment.</h3>
